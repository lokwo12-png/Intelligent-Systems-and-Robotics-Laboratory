# Main Robot Demo (Pygame)

## Overview
`main_robot.py` is a simple **robot control simulation** built using **Pygame**.  
It opens a small graphical window where a robot icon (or a circle if the image is unavailable) can be moved around using keyboard keys.  
The project demonstrates basic real-time graphics, keyboard input handling, and object motion control.

- Smooth and continuous movement with adjustable speed.
